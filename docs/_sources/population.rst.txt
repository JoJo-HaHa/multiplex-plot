Understanding data means understanding what it's made up of.
The population visualization lets you do just that.

.. note::

	Can't wait to start creating slope graphs?
	`Multiplex's Jupyter Notebook examples <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/tree/master/examples>`_ are a quick guide to get you up and running.
	Check out the `population charts Jupyter Notebook tutorial <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/blob/master/examples/7.%20Population%20charts.ipynb>`_ to learn how to create the time series shown above, or to start creating your own slope graph visualizations.
