There is one thing that is more important than anything else in Multiplex: the :class:`~drawable.Drawable` class.
All of Multiplex's visualizations revolve around it.
Indeed, if you are using Multiplex, you can—and should—work only with :class:`~drawable.Drawable` class.

.. image:: ../examples/exports/3-temperatures.png

To start working with a :class:`~drawable.Drawable`, create it from a normal plot:

.. code-block:: python

	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	from multiplex import drawable
	viz = drawable.Drawable(plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)))

That code block would use matplotlib's default plot.
If you want to plot on a particular axis, or a subplot, you can create it as follows instead:

.. code-block:: python

	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	from multiplex import drawable
	figure, axis = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(10, 10))
	viz = drawable.Drawable(figure, axis[0])

To learn more about how Multiplex works, keep reading the documentation.
If all you want is to get your hands dirty, take a look at the `examples <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/tree/master/examples>`_ directory.
Happy visualizing!
