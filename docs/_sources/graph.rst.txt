Graphs, or networks, show the structure of data through nodes and edges.
Although they are very useful to show interconnections, matplotlib does not support them out of the box.

Multiplex's graph visualization is built with the intent of making it easier to transform networks into stories.
The :class:`~graph.graph.Graph` class supports both undirected and directed networks, styling and legends.

.. note::

	`Multiplex's Jupyter Notebook examples <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/tree/master/examples>`_ are a quick guide to get you up and running with creating network graph visualizations.
	Check out the `network graph Jupyter Notebook tutorial <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/blob/master/examples/4.%20Network%20graphs.ipynb>`_ to learn how to create the above visualization, or to start creating your own network graph visualizations.
