Data can change as a result of time, action or a plethora of other reasons.
Although not as common as other visualizations, slope graphs are great to show how data changes.
Multiplex's slope graph makes it easier to show how data changes and tell a story.

.. note::

	Can't wait to start creating slope graphs?
	`Multiplex's Jupyter Notebook examples <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/tree/master/examples>`_ are a quick guide to get you up and running.
	Check out the `slope graphs Jupyter Notebook tutorial <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/blob/master/examples/6.%20Slope%20graphs.ipynb>`_ to learn how to create the time series shown above, or to start creating your own slope graph visualizations.
