Multiplex is a visualization library for Python built on `matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/>`_.
Multiplex is built on the principle that visualizations are about exploring and explaining data in a beautiful way.
For this reason, Multiplex is built with the intent of making it as easy as possible to transform data into visualizations.

Multiplex is aimed at data scientists who want to explore and explain data.
Currently, the library provides support for text visualizations, useful for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
In the future, it will also support other visualizations that are used in information retrieval tasks.

This documentation describes all of Multiplex's functionality.
