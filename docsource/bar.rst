Bar charts are one of the most intuitive types of visualizations.
As with the rest of the library, Multiplex makes it easier to create more complex types of bar charts.

At the moment, Multiplex supports only horizontal bar charts, not column charts.
Horizontal bar charts are slightly better for comparisons and readability because they are read from top to bottom.

.. note::

	Are you looking to create bar chart visualizations, not read the in-depth documentation about them?
	`Multiplex's Jupyter Notebook examples <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/tree/master/examples>`_ are a quick guide to get you up and running.
	Check out the `bar chart Jupyter Notebook tutorial <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/blob/master/examples/5.%20Bar%20charts.ipynb>`_ to learn how to create your own bar chart visualizations.
