# Multiplex - Examples

This directory contains examples of different visualizations to help get you started.
All the examples are IPython Notebooks, which means that you can open them and observe the code and its output next to each other right in GitHub.
More detailed documentation—including a full list of supported arguments—is available at the [documentation site](https://nicholasmamo.github.io/multiplex-plot/).

If you want to learn everything there is to know about Multiplex, start from the top: [1. Getting started](https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/blob/master/examples/1.%20Getting%20started.ipynb).
Where possible, all examples are self-contained.
Therefore if you are looking for a particular type of visualization, you can jump ahead.

Most importantly, the code in the notebooks is purposefully simple to help you get started right away.
Feel free to copy-and-paste the sample code and build on it: telling your story your way is what matters.
