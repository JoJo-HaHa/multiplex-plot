The :class:`~Graph` class can be used to draw directed or undirected graphs.
Each graph is made up of nodes and edges and can be used to show the relations between nodes.

.. note::

	The graph visualization uses the `networkx` package to generate the layout of the graph.
	Therefore it is a prerequisite to create these visualizations.
