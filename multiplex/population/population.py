Multiplex's population chart is a brand new type of visualization that builds on matplotlib.
This visualization makes it easy to show how different populations, in a broad sense, vary from each other.

    The :class:`~Population` class plots scatter points that represent populations.
    Like all visualizations, it stores a :class:`~drawable.Drawable` instance and revolves around the :func:`~Population.draw` function.

    To draw a population chart, create a :class:`~drawable.Drawable` class and call the :func:`~drawable.Drawable.draw_population` function.
    This method expects, at the very least, the values and the name of the 100% bar:

    .. code-block:: python

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from multiplex import drawable
        viz = drawable.Drawable(plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10)))
        viz.draw_population()
        viz.show()
