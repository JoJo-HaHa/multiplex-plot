"""
The :class:`text.text.TextAnnotation` class is mainly concerned with organizing text.
You can do just about anything with these visualizations, including—unsurprisingly enough—annotating the text.

To start creating time series visualizations, create a :class:`timeseries.timeseries.TimeSeries` instance and call the :meth:`timeseries.timeseries.TimeSeries.draw` method.
If you are using the :class:`drawable.Drawable` class, just call the :meth:`drawable.Drawable.draw_time_series` method on a :class:`drawable.Drawable` instance instead.

This method expects, at the very least, a `list` of text tokens.
Alternatively, you can provide a `list` of `dict` of tokens containing at least a `text` attribute and any of the other keys:

.. code-block:: python

	{
	  'label': None,
	  'style': { 'facecolor': 'None' },
	  'text': 'token',
	}

Instructions on how the text should be formatted can be passed on to the :meth:`text.text.TextAnnotation.draw` method.
Among others, these attributes include alignment and the line height.
The text can also be styled by passing on any attributes supported by the :class:`matplotlib.text.Text` class.
The same attributes can be passed on to the `style` key in the code block above.
You can find examples to help you get started `here <https://github.com/NicholasMamo/multiplex-plot/blob/master/examples/2.%20Text.ipynb>`_.
