The :class:`~Slope` class allows you to create slope graphs that show how values changed, such as:

- Before and after an operation, or
- Over a time period.

Slope graphs are not commonly included in visualization packages, but they can be great tools to tell a story.

    The :class:`~Slope` class builds on the :class:`~labelled.LabelledVisualization`.
    The reason behind this is that each slope in the visualization has a label associated with it.
    In these cases, the :class:`~labelled.LabelledVisualization` automatically ensures that the labels do not overlap.
