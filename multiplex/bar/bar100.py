"""
The :class:`~bar.100.Bar100` visualization draws stacked bar charts that all add up to 100%.
The 100% bar chart visualization is useful to show the make-up of data.

This visualization is based on `matplotlib's barh <https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.barh.html>`_ function.
However, it also comes with functionality to make it easier to construct 100% bar chart visualizations.
For example, you don't have to provide percentages; the :class:`~bar.100.Bar100` visualization automatically converts numbers to percentages.
